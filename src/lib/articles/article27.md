#### Evaluation metrics in machine learning are crucial for evaluating, comparing, and improving models.

<br>

## **Accuracy Metric**
Definition: Accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions, multiplied by 100.

<br>

## **Precision Metric**
Definition: Precision focuses on Type-I errors (False Positives). A Type-I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected.
* A higher precision score indicates a more precise model.
* A low precision score (< 0.5) indicates a model with many false positives.

<br>

## **Recall Metric**
Definition: Recall is the ratio of true positives to all the positives in the ground truth. It focuses on Type-II errors (False Negatives). A Type-II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is accepted.

<br>

## **F1-Score Metric**
Definition: The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the two metrics.
A low F1-score indicates issues with either precision or recall (or both).
A high F1-score indicates high precision and recall, showing a well-performing model.

<br>

## **Importance and Application**
* Evaluation: They provide an objective measure of a model's ability to make accurate predictions.
* Comparison: Metrics allow for the comparison of different models to select the best one for a specific task.
* Optimization: Metrics guide the optimization and hyperparameter tuning process.
* Monitoring: Continuous evaluation using metrics helps in detecting issues like overfitting or concept drift early.
* Decision-Making: Metrics enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by understanding model performance in the context of business objectives.

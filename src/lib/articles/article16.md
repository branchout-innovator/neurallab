Data Augmentation techniques 
Written by: Sana Abobakr 
Data augmentation techniques can be used to produce distinct versions of a set of data in order to increase its size. 
Data augmentation techniques in computer vision 
Adding noise - black and white dots, most useful when dealing with a blurry image 

Cropping - adjusting the size of the image 
Flipping - rearranges the pixels without changing the image’s features to flip it vertically or horizontally 

Rotation - an image can be rotated anywhere from 0-360 degrees 

Scaling - can make an object in an image appear smaller or bigger 

Translation - The image can be moved to various areas on the x-axis and the y-axis to allow the neural network to look everywhere in the image so it’s captured 

Brightness - the coloring of the image can be made lighter or darker when the brightness is adjusted allowing the neural network to recognize the image in different levels of lighting 

Contrast - changing the contrast of the image changes the luminance and the color 

Color augmentation - the image’s color changes due to new pixel values 

Saturation - the density and depth of the image’s color 

Data augmentation techniques in natural language models
Easy data augmentation methods - include easy text transformations, synonym replacement, text substitution, random insertion, random swap, random deletion, word and sentence shifting 
Back translation - translate the sentence in a language, then translates it back to the original sentence so a new sentence is created 
Text generation - generative adversarial networks are instructed to generate text with only a few words 
Data augmentation techniques for audio data 
Include:
Cutting out a portion of data 
Noise injection 
Shifting time 
Speed tuning changing pitch
Mixing background noise and masking frequency 
Advanced data augmentation techniques 
Commonly in deep learning techniques such as:
Adversarial training 
Neural style transfer 
Generative adversarial networks based augmentation

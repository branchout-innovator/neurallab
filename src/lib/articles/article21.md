* Database Access: Often includes Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools for simplified database interactions.
* Security: Built-in features like input validation, authentication, and authorization to protect applications.
* Form Handling: Tools for managing and validating form data, making web form creation easier.
* Middleware: Components that add functionality to the request/response pipeline, such as logging and error handling.
* Development Tools: Features like live reloading, debugging aids, and scaffolding to speed up development.
* Scalability: Optimizations and best practices to build scalable applications.

## **SvelteKit**
SvelteKit specifically allows you to “write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser”. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. SvelteKit, compared to other web frameworks, is easy to use and efficient for modern web applications, such as Neual Lab.

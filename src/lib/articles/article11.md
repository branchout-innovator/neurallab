## **Overview**

Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNNs). designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem that affects traditional RNNs making it difficult for them to capture long-range dependencies. By controlling the flow of information LSTMs can help maintain gradients mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. They are suitable for tasks with long-term dependencies, such as language modeling, machine translation, speech recognition, and more complex time series forecasting.

## **Vanishing gradient problem**

The vanishing gradient problem is caused by gradients (which are used to optimize the loss function) getting smaller and smaller as they backpropagate. During this process, gradients are propagated from the output layer back to the input layer, and weights are updated using gradient descent. In deep networks, the gradients are products of partial derivatives of the activation functions with respect to their inputs. If these partial derivatives are small (less than 1), multiplying many such small numbers leads to an exponentially small gradient as it moves backward through the network.

## **Structure of LSTMs**

LSTMs have a more complicated structure than RNNs with a cell state that carries information through the sequence and three gates as opposed to the traditional RNNâ€™s single hidden state. The input gate decides what new information to store in the cell state, the output gate decides the next hidden state, and the forget gate decides what information to discard from the cell state.

## **Comparison with RNNs**

LSTMs are more complex than RNNs and are not vulnerable to the vanishing gradient problem making them more suitable for tasks with long-term dependencies. However they are also slower to train due to their complexity making them less suitable than RNNs for simpler tasks with shorter dependencies.

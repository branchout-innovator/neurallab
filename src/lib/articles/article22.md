Libraries for data manipulation are essential tools in various programming languages, providing functions and methods to efficiently handle, process, and transform data. Here are some of the most popular libraries used for data manipulation in different programming languages:
## **Pandas**:
A powerful library for data analysis and manipulation, providing data structures like DataFrames for handling structured data.This data can be structured in tables or spreadsheets. 
Features:
* Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
* Reshaping and pivoting of datasets.
* Merging and joining datasets.
* Time series functionality.
## **NumPy**:
A fundamental package for scientific computing, offering support for arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions.
Features:
* N-dimensional array object.
* Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.
* Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
* Linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

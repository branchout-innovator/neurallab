**Data visualization** is the process of graphical representation of data in the shape of charts, sparklines, infographics, etc. Presenting data through visual elements allows for it to be more easily analyzed. Data visualization is a crucial part of grabbing people’s attention. A **data visualization tool** is a tool that allows for the visualization of data. The data visualization tool’s features allow for data to be graphically altered. Every data visualization tool has to have at least one feature in common with other data visualization tools. Better tools have the ability to create charts, graphs, and maps.

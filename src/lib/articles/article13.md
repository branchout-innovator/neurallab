#### A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of neural networks created to process sequences of data, so it is well suited for tasks that involve time series or sequential data. RNNs maintain a hidden shape through connections that loop back on themselves. The hidden state allows for RNNs to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sequences.

## **The RNN’s structure is made up of 3 main layers:**
* The input layer - retains the input data at any point in the time sequence 
* The hidden layer - upholds the hidden state which functions as the network’s memory through retaining information from previous time steps.
* The output layer - generates classifications or predictions

## **Examples of RNN applications:**

<br>

### Natural language processing 
* Language modeling - RNNs can be used to predict the next word in a sentence 
* Machine translation - one RNN can be used to encode the input sentence and the other can be used to decode it in the target language 
* Sentiment analysis - RNNs capture contextual information from words in a sequence to analyze text  

<br>

### Speech recognition and synthesis 
* Speech-to-text - RNNs can be used to turn spoken language into written text 
* Text-to-speech RNNs can also be used to turn written text into spoken language 
* Time-series analysis and forecasting 
* Financial forecasting - RNNs can be used to forecast the prices of stocks, currency exchange rates, etc. 
* Weather prediction - RNNs can make future weather predictions by analyzing prior weather data

### Music generation 
#### RNNs can be used to generate music sequences through learning patterns from already existing music compositions to produce new compositions 
Video analysis and action recognition 
* Video understanding - RNNs can be used to process frames in a video sequence to better understand activities, actions, and objects 
* Gesture recognition - RNNs can be used to recognize hand movements in videos which can be used for uses such as sign language translation 
Robotics and autonomous systems 
* Path prediction - RNNs can be used to help robots predict paths of moving objects and plan their movements based off of that 
* Gesture control - gesture control can allow RNNs to be be used to interact with robots
Language generation and dialogue systems  
* Chatbots - RNNs produce logical responses in conversations in order to power chatbots 
* Storytelling - if a prompt is submitted to the RNN it can produce stories

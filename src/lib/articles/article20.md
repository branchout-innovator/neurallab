#### Deep learning is essentially a subset of machine learning which relies on structures similar to the human brain (neural networks).

#### A deep learning framework is a software package that allows a person to train their deep learning models without understanding most of the algorithms of the model itself. TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, developed by Google.

#### Tensorflow is a toolkit to help computers learn given data. Tensorflow teaches computers how to recognize patterns given data. Tensorflow operates as follows: 
* Tensorflow builds deep learning models with input layers, hidden layers, and output layers
* Tensorflow teaches the model by inputting lots of data and adjusting its nodes to improve performance based on the data
* Tensorflow evaluates the model to see its learning based on an error calculation (MSE, MAE, Huber, etc.)
* Tensorflow then saves the model

#### Tensorflow has several advantages over other models: 
* Tensorflow is easy to use, with many tools available and easy to understand even for beginners
* Tensorflowâ€™s computation graph is optimized for many hardware-configurations, making it more efficient than other networks
* Tensorflow is flexible and able to run on many different software configurations

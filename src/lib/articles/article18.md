## **MNIST Dataset**
The MNIST dataset, or Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, was developed by LeCun, Cortes and Burges for learning models. The MNIST dataset contains 10,000 testing cases of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and 60,000 training cases.  Each image is 28x28 pixels.

The MNIST dataset is simple and uniform, as each image is normalized and centered. This preprocessing ensures that the dataset is relatively clean and free from noise, making it easier for algorithms to learn and recognize patterns. Despite its simplicity, the dataset presents a sufficient challenge to drive advancements in the field, especially in the development of neural networks and deep learning models.

It has become a standard testbed for evaluating the performance of various algorithms, from traditional machine learning methods like k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines to more advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

## **CIFAR-10 Dataset**
The Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) - 10 dataset was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. It consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all at a resolution of 32x32 pixels. The dataset is organized into 10 different classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. Similarly, there is CIFAR-100 with 100 classes instead.

## **ImageNet**
ImageNet is a large visual database used for object recognition research, featuring over 14 million hand-annotated images with bounding boxes in about one million of them. 

It includes more than 20,000 categories, with each category containing several hundred images. Since 2010, ImageNet has hosted the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to classify and detect objects and scenes from a subset of 1,000 categories.

## **ObjectNet**
Object net has 50,000 test photos with controls for viewpoint, rotation, and backdrop and 313 distinct object classes, 113 of which have ImageNet overlap. Object net includes objects in odd places, allowing for models to be thoroughly tested and trained.

## **Scene Understanding (SUN) dataset**
THe Scene Understanding dataset has 108,753 photos, of which 76,128 are training photos. Each picture has a maxim of 120,000 pixels. 

<br>

## **Intel Image Classification dataset**

Intel Image Classification dataset  contains about 25,000 images that are grouped into categories like streets, buildings, woods, mountains, seas, and glaciers.
